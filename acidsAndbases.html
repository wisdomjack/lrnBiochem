							<h3>1.Intro: acids and bases</h3>
							<p>Historically scientists came up with 3 definitions definitions of acids and bases. In biochemistry we work with <b>Brønsted–Lowry definition.</b> In the Brønsted–Lowry theory acids and bases are defined by the way they react with each other: <b>an acid donates a proton (H+) and a base accepts a proton.</b> Therefor, it is a proton transfer reaction. The species then form conjugate pairs.</p>
							<center><img class="acid_base" src="images/acid_base.jpeg" alt="" display=block margin-left=auto margin-right=auto width=45% height=45%/></center>

							<p>Acids and bases can be divide into <b>strong</b> and <b>weak</b>. You will encounter problems that will involve strong and weak acids/bases. Both of these types of problems will have its own strategies and shortcuts, therefore it is important that you can identify what type of acid or base you are dealing with.</p>
							<br>
							<br>

							<h3>2.Strong acids and bases</h3>
							<p><b>Strong acids</b> such as HCl, HNO3 and H2SO4 dissociate completely in aqueous solution (water) into H3O+ hydronium and conjugate bases Cl-, NO3-, SO4- respectively.<!--  Yes, strong acids have conjugate bases, it is important to keep in mind that all chemical process at least in theory are reversible. However, because the Ka values for strong acids are so large, we simply ignore them and do not use them in calculations. -->
							Some students get confused between H3O+ and H+. Note that in water H+ does not exists by itself, because it is too reactive it will react with H2O to form H3O+, however for simplicity H+ and H3O+ are used interchangeably.</p>

							<p><b>Strong bases</b> such as NaOH and KOH dissociate completely in in aqueous solution (water) into OH- hydroxide and conjugate acids Na+ and K+ respectively.</p>

							<p><center><img class="acid_base" src="images/strongacid.png" style="max-width: 100%" /></center>
							<center><font color="#585858"><p style="text-align: center;">Notice how the equilibrium arrow points only to the right, signifying complete dissociation of the strong acid.</font></p></center><br><br>

							<div class="problems">
								<h3>How to calculate it?</h3><br>
								<p>When it comes to strong acid/base the calculations are very straight forward.<br>
								<b>pH = -log[H3O+]</b><br><br>
								Since strong acid dissociate completely into H3O+ and the conjugate base the concentration of acid is going to be equal the concentration of H3O+, therefore:<br>
								<b>pH = -log[Strong Acid]</b><br>
								<div class="beware">Beware:</div> In case of a strong base, we first calculate the pOH and then convert it to pH<br>
								<b>pOH = -log[Strong Base]</b><br>
								<b>pH = 14 - pOH</b><br><br>
								<div class="beware">Beware:</div> This strategy will only work for strong acid/base that are at high concentrations. Imagine that you drop a small amount of strong acid into a large bucket of water, making the final conc of the acid 1*10^-8 M. By above logic:<br>
								pH = -log[1*10-8] = 8<br>
								But wait a minute, you just dropped a strong acid into water, but your pH increased in other words became more basic?! Consider alternative situation, you have very dilute strong base, 1*10^-8 M.<br>
								pOH = -log[1*10^-8 M] = 8<br>
								pH = 14 - 8 = 6<br>
								Again, we seem to have the same problem. The pH should be more basic not acid. The simple explanation is that naturally the pH of water is 7, which by definition means that there are always 1*10^-7 M H+ ions already present in water. So as long as the concentration of the strong acid/base is below 1*10^-7 it will not change the pH of water. In reality it will change the pH slightly and there are ways to calculate precisely how much but for the purposes of our class we ignore it. <br>
								<div class="beware">Memorize it:</div> This will 100% be on the exam. If you are asked to calculate pH of a strong acid/base at the conc. below 1*10^-7, you can simply put:<br>
								<b>pH = 7</b><br>    
								</p>
							</div><br><br><br><br><br>

							<h3>3.Weak acids and bases</h3>

							<p><b>Weak acids</b> such as CH3COOH (acetic acid) only partially dissociate in water into H+ and conjugate base CH3COO- (acetate).</p>

							<p><b>Weak bases</b> such as NH3 (ammonia) are best described as a partial proton acceptor that react with water to produce OH- and conjugate acid NH4+.<br> <span class="beware">Beware: </span> This is a good example of why we use Brønsted–Lowry acid/base definition.</p>

							<p><center><img class="acid_base" src="images/weakacid.png" style="max-width:100%" /></center>
							<center><font color="#585858"><p style="text-align: center;"> Notice how the equilibrium arrow points in both directions, signifying partial dissociation of the weak acid.</p></font></center><br></p>


							<div class="problems">
								<h3>How to calculate it?</h3><br>
								
								<p>
								To find out the pH of a weak acid solution we use the same equation that we used to find out pH of a strong acid:<br>
								<b>pH = -log[H3O+]</b><br><br>
								However, since weak acid only partially dissociate in water, the conc. of H3O+ ions is not equal to the conc. of the weak acid. We need to use acid disassociation constant Ka to find the conc of H3O.<br><br>

								

								<span class="eq-c">
								<b>Ka</b> =
								<span class="fraction">
								<span class="fup">[Products]</span>
								<span class="bar">/</span>
								<span class="fdn">[Reactants]</span>
								</span>
								= 
								</span>

								<span class ="eq-c">
								
								<sapn class="fraction">
								<span class="fup">[H3O+][Conjugate Base-]</span>
								<span class="bar">/</span>
								<span class="fdn">[Weak Acid]</span>
								</span><br><br>

								<div class="beware">Example:<br>
								Calculate pH of a 0.01 M benzoic acid solution.<br><br></div>
								Ka (benzoic acid) = 6.5*10^(-5). Usually givem, or you can Google it.<br><br>  

								Luckily, we know that conc. of H3O+ and conjugate base will be the same, because both are products of the same proton transfer reaction. We can exploit this property to find out conc of H3O+. To keep calculations organized we will use an <b>Initial Change Equilibrium (ICE) table</b>. To understand this table imagine you are dissolving weak acid in water. <b>Initially</b> you have weak acid and water. Immediately after mixing the two together the concentrations of all species (water, weak acid, H3O+ and conjugate base) will <b>Change</b>. After some time the <b>Equilibrium</b> will be established and the conc. of all species will remain constant.<br><br>

								<b>ICE table:</b>

								<!-- ICE TABLE: -->
								<center><img class="acid_base" src="images/ice_table.png" alt="" display=block margin-left=auto margin-right=auto width=90% height=90%/></center><br>

								Next, set the Ka equal to the ICE table values:<br>

								<span class ="eq-c">
								Ka = 6.5*10^(-5) =
								<sapn class="fraction">
								<span class="fup">[x][x]</span>
								<span class="bar">/</span>
								<span class="fdn">[0.01 - x]</span>
								</span><br>

								Notice, since x is going to be very small relative to the weak acid conc, we can drop it from the denominator.<br>


								<span class ="eq-c">
								Ka = 6.5*10^(-5) =
								<sapn class="fraction">
								<span class="fup">[x][x]</span>
								<span class="bar">/</span>
								<span class="fdn">[0.01]</span>
								</span><br><br>

								Solving, this equation is now trivial.<br>

								6.5*10^(-5) * [0.01] = [x][x]<br>
								6.5*10^(-7) = x^2<br>
								x = <math><msqrt><mi>6.5*10^(-7)</mi></msqrt></math>
								x = 8.06*10^-4<br><br>

								<div class="beware">Beware: </div>Remember that x represents [H3O+] and pH = -log[H30+], therefore the final answer is: 

								pH = -log(x)<br>
								pH = -log(8.06*10^-4)<br>
								pH =  3.09
								</p>
							</div><br><br><br><br><br>

							<h3>4.Buffers</h3><br>

							<p>
							Buffers are water solutions of weak acid/base that are used to control pH.<br>
							Buffers are kinda like springs. No matter how hard you push the spring, it always relaxes back. Unless of course you go bananas and break the spring!<br><br>

							To appreciate buffers, you have to truly understand two things:<br>
							1. Weak acid conjugate base are two pairs of the same molecule. And vise versa for weak base/conjugate acid.<br>
							2. Acid/base reactions are happening in water. 

							<!-- Buffers figure -->
							<p><center><img class="acid_base" src="images/buffer.jpeg" style="max-width:100%; height:40%; width:40%" /></center>
							<center><font color="#585858"><p style="text-align: center;"> CH3COOH and its conjugate base CH3COO- form buffer in water. If we add some H3O, normally it would lower the pH, because pH = [H3O+]. However, instead H3O+ will react with CH3COO- to produce H2O and CH3COOH. Likewise, addition of OH- does not cause, pH to rise.</p></font></center><br></p><br><br>


							<h3>4.1Titration</h3>

							<p>Is a technique that involves slow dripping "titration" of a strong acid/base into a solution of weak acid/base that could be used to:<br>
								<ol>
									<li>Determine unknown conc. of the weak acid or base.</li>
									<li>Determine unknown strength or Ka of the acid/base.</li>
									<li>Prepare a buffer solution.</li>
								</ol>
							</p>  


							<p><center><img class="acid_base" src="images/tittration2.jpeg" style="max-width:100%; height:100%; width:100%" /></center>


							<center><font color="#585858"><p style="text-align: center;">This is an example how a titration of weak acid CH3COOH with strong base OH- is performed. At first, we only have CH3COOH in an acidic solution, so the pH=0. In step two, we add 0.5 equivalents of the OH- or 50% of OH- that is required to completely deprotonate the CH3COOH, this is why it is called <b>half equivalence point.</b> At this point the ratio of CH3COOH/CH3COO- = 0.5</b>. In step 3, we add another 0.5 and completley deprotonate the CH3COOH converting 100% of it into CH3COO-, an thus we call it <b>equivalence point</b></p></font></center></p>

							<span class="beware">Beware: </span>Equivalents represent the number of protons that can titrate, in the case of CH3COOH it is 1.<br><br><br><br>

							<div class="problems">
								<h3>How to calculate it?</h3><br>
								
								<p><b>Henderson-Hasselbalch</b> equation should be the first thing that comes to your mind whenever you think of buffers.<br>

								<div class="eq-c">
								<b>pH = pKa + log

								<span class="bar">/</span>
								<span class="fdn">[HA]</span>
								</div>
								</sup>
								</b>
								</div><br>

								We can use this equation to prove that at the half equivalence point pH = pKa.<br>
								At the half equivalence point:<br><br>

								[A-] = 0.5 and [HA] = 0.5 <br> 
								

								Therefore, [A-]/[HA] = 1<br>
								And log (1) = 0<br><br>

								<div class="beware">Example:<br>
								Prepare 1L of 0.1 M buffer of CH3COOH Acetic acid (Ka = 1.76*10^-5) at pH = 5.<br>
								A. If you are given stock 1 M CH3COOH and 1 M CH3COO-<br> 
								B. If you are given stock 1 M CH3COOH and 1 M NaOH<br><br></div>

								<b>A.1</b> Begin by solving Henderson-Hasselbalch:<br>

								</sup>
								</div><br>

								The result of Henderson-Hasselbalch gives us a <b>ratio</b> of base/acid. Think if it makes sense that the ratio is higher than 1 in our case? Look back at the titration curve of the acetic acid. Do we have more of the acid form (HA) or base form (A-) at pH 5?<br>
								(Answer: We have more of the base form)<br><br>

								<b>A.2</b> Calculate the <b>fraction</b> of acid and the <b>fraction</b> of base.<br><br>

								by definition of fraction:<br>
								[A-] + [HA] = 1<br>
								[A-] = 1 - [HA]<br><br>

								And we know that:<br>

								<div class="eq-c">
								1.76 = 
								<div class="fraction">
								<span class="fup">[A-]</span>
								<span class="bar">/</span>
								<span class="fdn">[HA]</span>
								</div>
								</sup>
								</div>

								[A-] = 1.76[HA]<br><br>

								Therefore:<br>
								1.76[HA] + [HA] = 1<br>
								2.76[HA] = 1<br>
								[HA] = 1/2.76<br>
								[HA] = 0.36<br><br>

								And since we already solved that:
								[A-] = 1 - [HA]<br>
								[A-] = 1 - 0.36<br>
								[A-] = 0.64<br>

								Now we know the <b>fractions</b> of [HA] = 0.36 and [A-] = 0.64. Again think about it does that makes scene that the base fraction is bigger?<br><br>

								<b>A.3</b> Next, we need to find the actual <b>molar concentrations</b> of [HA] and [A-] of the desired buffer. This step is pretty easy, since we already know the fractions we just multiply them by the desired concentrations:<br><br>

								[A-] = 0.36 * 0.1 M (of CH3COO-) = 0.036 M<br>
								[HA] = 0.64 * 0.1 M (of CH3COOH) = 0.064 M<br><br>

								<b>A.4</b> And finally we are ready to calculate the <b>volumes</b> of [HA] and [A-]. For that we will use a dilution equation:<br><br>

								Dilution equation: (Stock Concentration)*(Stock Volume) = (Desired Concentration)*(Desired Volume).<br>

								Assume that the Stock Volume is unknown and set it x, and solve for x:<br><br>

								(1 M)(x) = (0.036 M)(1L)<br>

								<div class="eq-c">
								x = 
								<div class="fraction">
								<span class="fup">(0.036 M)(1L)</span>
								<span class="bar">/</span>
								<span class="fdn">(1 M)</span>
								</div>
								</sup>
								</div>

								x = 0.036L or 36ml of CH3COOH<br><br>

								And<br><br>

								(1 M)(x) = (0.064 M)(1L)<br>

								<div class="eq-c">
								x = 
								<div class="fraction">
								<span class="fup">(0.064 M)(1L)</span>
								<span class="bar">/</span>
								<span class="fdn">(1 M)</span>
								</div>
								</sup>
								</div>

								x = 0.064L or 64ml of CH3COO-<br><br>

								So, to finalize:<br>

								36ml of CH3COOH<br>
								64ml of CH3COO-<br>
								900ml of H2O, do not forget about the water!<br>

								<br><br>


								<b>B.</b> This problem is only slightly different. If we are given stock of weak acid, but instead of its conjugate base, we are given strong base, the trick is to recognize that weak acid and its conjugate base are two forms of the same molecule. Therefore we can generate one form from the other with strong acid or base. We perform the same calculations but at the end we add:<br><br> 

								100ml of CH3COOH (64ml + 36ml)<br>
								64ml of NaOH <br> 
								836ml of H2O<br>
